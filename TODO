Update TODO file, if something is implemented, it should be removed in the TODO file.
Mantain TODO file as clear as possible

- Events, events, events. There are lots of them pending (see TODO.Events).
- /timer as a module
- It would be cool if KVIrc could to delete old log files automatically
	(configurable, of course), to avoid disk ocupation. For example, delete (or
	move to trash) 15-days old log files automatically (configurable by user).
- html colored logs (with icons ? configurable with an option)
  SHould get the available modes from RPL_ISUPPORT and show them in the box
- CService support
	We already have nickserv support, why not CService/X support? This should be much much easier to
	implement as it's only on one net (Undernet), and with a static host and command that never changes, we
	only need to specify password.
