This file contains all the things that have to be done to complete the
transition autotools -> cmake.

* Missing targets:
- create and test build and install rules for the win32 target

* Missing or broken rules
- header installation (useful?)
- uninstall: delete userdocs (generated by gendoc.pl)
- uninstall: delete directories

* Translation
- create a make target for updating *.pot/*.po files
- Cleanup: move the install target from cmake/modules/FindGetText
        to a better place
