This file contains all the things that have to be done to complete the
transition autotools -> cmake.

* Missing or broken rules
- header installation (useful?)
- uninstall: delete userdocs (generated by gendoc.pl)
- uninstall: delete directories
- modules capabilities: some menu entries are missing due to not-handling
  caps/ dir in some modules

* Translation
- should be ok, needs proper testing
