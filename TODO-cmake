Bug on translations
-------------------
make messages-update
   all ok (extracts, updates and tidies *.po files)

make messages-update-$module
   it only updates the $module.po file. This leads to an old $module.po file and we
   have to call make messages-extract-$module first.

make messages-tidy-$module
   where is it?
