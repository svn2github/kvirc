This directory and the subdirectories contain a set of KVIrc scripting examples/tests.

The *.kvs files in this directory are mostly tests written while implementing scripting
language features. They're rather simple (but also useless) so you can use them to learn basic scripting :)

The subdirectories contain more complex scripts written with the demonstration purpose.
