============================================================================

	This is more or less how I build a KVIrc 3 Debian package:

	1. Copy the following files into kvirccvs, i.e. into the directory where
	kvirc/ is in:
	       Makefile.generic
	       Makefile

	2. If you do an 'ls' now you should see something like this:
			Makefile Makefile.generic kvirc/ modules/ etc...

	3. Run "make release"

    --------------------------------------------------------------------

	If you change the order of the DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS= lines in the
	Makefile you can choose whether you want to build a package with debug
	symbols left in.

	Interesting targets to call are:

	checkout      Retrieve the new source from CVS.
	update        Update the current local source tree.
	setup         Create a source tree which is ready to be used for
	              a Debian source package. Among other things, the configure
				  script will have been created.
	build         Build packages for local use.
	release       Build packages ready to be released in Debian.
	valgrind      Run KVIrc 3 under valgrind.
	mpatrol       Run KVIrc 3 under mpatrol.
