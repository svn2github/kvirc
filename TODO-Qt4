Here there is all porting work to do.
Files listed below need working to be ported to Qt4.
They still have Qt3 code, unworking Qt4 code, q3support, fuzzy ifdefs
os simply they're still the old unchecked kvirc3 files.


PLEASE KEEP THIS FILE UPDATED!

src/kvirc/kernel
	kvi_iconmanager.cpp
src/kvirc/ui:
	kvi_ircviewtools.cpp (graphic bug in panel view)
	kvi_statusbar.cpp (QT4 ported but still some bugs)
	kvi_mdichild.cpp (bug in resize)
		All MDI stuff will be reworked to use Qt subsystem
		See branches/kvirc/qt-mdi/
	kvi_menubar.cpp
src/modules
	iograph - all excluded by #if
	notifier <-done, needs fixing
	theme <-done, needs fixing (dynamic tooltip)


Note: some code depends on kde3-only functionality, like dcop:
src/kvilib/ext/kvi_dcophelper.*
src/modules/torrent/*  <-- adaptable, but by now supports only dcop communication
