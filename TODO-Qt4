Here there is all porting work to do.
Files listed below need working to be ported to Qt4.
They still have unworking Qt4 code, q3support, fuzzy ifdefs
os simply they're still the old unchecked kvirc3 files.


PLEASE KEEP THIS FILE UPDATED!

src/kvirc/ui:
	kvi_statusbar.cpp (QT4 ported but still some bugs)
	kvi_mdichild.cpp (bug in resize)
		All MDI stuff will be reworked to use Qt subsystem
		See branches/kvirc/qt-mdi/
src/modules
	theme <-done, needs fixing (dynamic tooltip)


Note: some code depends on kde3-only functionality, like dcop:
src/kvilib/ext/kvi_dcophelper.*
src/modules/torrent/*  <-- adaptable, but by now supports only dcop communication

By now, this code has been excluded using the bogus "#ifdef COMPILE_KDE3_SUPPORT" directive, while
the working code for kde4 uses #ifdef COMPILE_KDE_SUPPORT
