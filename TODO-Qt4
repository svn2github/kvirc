Here there is all porting work to do.
Files listed below need working to be ported to Qt4.
They still have unworking Qt4 code, q3support, fuzzy ifdefs
os simply they're still the old unchecked kvirc3 files.


PLEASE KEEP THIS FILE UPDATED!

src/kvirc/ui:
	kvi_statusbar.cpp (QT4 ported but still some bugs)
src/modules
	theme <-done, needs fixing (dynamic tooltip)
	torrent <- has to be finished (when ktorrent dbus interface will stabilize)
