Here there is all porting work to do.
Files listed below need working to be ported to Qt4.
They still have Qt3 code, unworking Qt4 code, q3support, fuzzy ifdefs
os simply they're still the old unchecked kvirc3 files.

Qt3 support member convertFromImage() seems to behave differently than
Qt4 fromImage(), hence the transparency is currently broken and needs
to be revised.
Qt3 Support Member: bool QPixmap::convertFromImage ( const QImage & image, ColorMode mode )
Qt4: QPixmap QPixmap::fromImage ( const QImage & image, Qt::ImageConversionFlags flags = Qt::AutoColor )   [static]
some changes in code were just
s/convertFromImage/fromImage/ (for example revision 1886)
which doesn't sound right
(affected is g_pShadedChildGlobalDesktopBackground from
 src/kvirc/kernel/kvi_app.cpp and possibly some other)
