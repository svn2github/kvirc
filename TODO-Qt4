Here there is all porting work to do.
Files listed below need working to be ported to Qt4.
They still have unworking Qt4 code, q3support, fuzzy ifdefs
os simply they're still the old unchecked kvirc3 files.


PLEASE KEEP THIS FILE UPDATED!

src/kvirc/ui:
	kvi_statusbar.cpp (ported to QT4, bug reordering applets using the mouse is bugged)
src/modules
	addons <- done, needs graphical fixing
	theme <- done, needs graphical fixing
	torrent <- has yet to be finished (when ktorrent dbus interface will stabilize)
