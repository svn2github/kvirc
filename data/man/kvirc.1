The optional <channel> is joined just after the connection
has been estabilished.

.SH FILES

\fB$PREFIX\fP/share/kvirc/\fBVERSION\fP/*
Directory with the global KVIrc settings , modules etc...

\fB$HOME\fP/.kvircrc This is the first file that KVIrc looks for.
If the \-c commandline option is specified , the file passed
as the option parameter is used instead of this one.
If the file is found , KVIrc reads the first non-empty line
and treats it as the path to the \fIKVIrc Local directory\fP.
If the file can not be found or the \fIKVIrc Local directory\fP
is not existing , KVIrc enters the setup mode and allows
selecting a new \fIKVIrc Local directory\fP.

\fBKVIrc Local directory\fP/*
Directory with the local (per user) KVIrc settings.
Similar to the global one.
